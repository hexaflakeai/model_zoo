# model_zoo

This directory mainly gathers open-source deep learning models adapted by Hexaflake. Under each model folder, the user can find model transformation, Test script, or modify the model based on this, and deploy it to the Hexaflake TOCA platform.


#Environmental preparation

This project relies on Hexaflake software and hardware, and compilation requires the TOCA software stack. Please contact sales/pre-sales in advance to obtain and install it.
